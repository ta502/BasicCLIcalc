## BASIC-CLI-CALC
Pretty bare-bones command line calculator, it has the 4 main math operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiply
- Division 

That's it, it's my first beginner project.

**NOTE:** Keep in mind that it's just a beginner project, so you might find bad code, don't take it too seriously.
